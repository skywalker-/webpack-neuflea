# Neuflea – Corporate Marketplace (OLX-style App)

Neuflea is a prototype of an internal or B2B classifieds platform — think **OLX for corporate users**. It allows authenticated users to post, browse, and manage listings for physical goods, digital tools, or services across a company or org network.
